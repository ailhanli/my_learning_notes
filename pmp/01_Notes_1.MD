PMP Notes

One of the main job of PMP is adhering timeline. Normally everything is ongoing but in some cases our some participator cannot done job immediatley because of dependecy. In this case we have talk and asked when will they finished current task on the time.
Lets assume subtask takes 2 weeks. They didnt return in one week. We have to ask them how can we speed up process? 

For example
Do you have any estimation about the date for the readiness of the tools on your side?  As per the project timelines aligned internally, we suppose to complete Rehearsal 0 activities by end of next week and resources have been allocated on our side accordingly.

Is there anything that we can help with to speed up the process?



In case we dont get any response for our email. 

We can send an email again something like 



Did you get a chance to do something? and talk about timeline or next job if it is ready
